    <p> <em>This may be fake information about me. </em></p>
    <p> I have 4 children and a wonderful husband. I have 2 dogs and often a spare foster puppy with me during the day. I have my work space set up in my backyard in a yurt. In it, I have my computer and a large table to do projects on plus other random stuff that I think is useful. I am getting my certificate in Graphic Design. I love visual design. I have a client right now who is trying to rethink how we, as a group, use cups at coffee shops. They are trying to eliminate single-use plastics as the go-to for everyone. Though I was scared to take this class, I am learning that I love web development too. It feels powerful to be able to change the look and feel of the ubiquitous webpages that are all around us and that we use every day of our lives. In my spare time, I have a bunch of different interests, but I like coming up with plans for my neighbors to execute on. For example, I was the one who thought to locate the splash down machine for our block party this summer which happened to fall on a day reaching well over 100 degrees. Needless to say, everyone was pretty much walking around soaking wet for the entire party. Very fun, indeed. </p>
